# Node Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate to start Node projects with. It includes the following features:

### Express

Built with express and taking advantage of middleware such as a view engine, a request logger, and routers.

### User registration

This app takes advantage of mongoose to register users and store their information. It also allows users to log in and become authenticated via JWTs.

### Authentication

Provided through Passport, Bcrypt, and JWTs to allow users to log in and stay authenticated throughout the site without needing a server-side session.

### A cute dog photo

For morale.
