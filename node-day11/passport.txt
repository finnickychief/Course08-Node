Passport:
  Passport is an authentication middleware specifically for NodeJS
  It employs middleware itself called "strategies" - These are the rules for authentication.
  If we want to use externals ones such as Facebook, Github, Google we can import those strategies, or we can define our own locally.


Additional libraries:
  Passport 
  passport-local // The library that allows you to define your own strategy to authenticate a user
  connect-flash // A library to display flash messages to the user

  passport-local-mongoose // Allows us to use our local strategy along with our Mongoose schema - Also provides a few additional utility functions for it.
  mongoose-unique-validator // handles a few extra edge cases that mongoose doesn't, more efficiently
