	Create a form to input your favorite animal and save it to cookies. 
  
  Add this animal both to the database for Animals, and store it as a session cookie for the user that was logged in at the time. 
  
  Place the link to the animalForm on the root/home (‘/‘) page for your site. 
  
  If the animal isn’t set, have it link to the form to create the animal.
