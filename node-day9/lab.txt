Lab:

  First we copy the controller/route/model for Animals

	Create a form to input your favorite animal and save it to cookies. 
  // views/animalForm.ejs: created, routes/animals.js: Added render for form
  
  Add this animal both to the database for Animals, and store it as a session cookie for the user that was logged in at the time. 
  // routes/animals.js: Added cookies after the database insertion. Redirected to home after success
  
  Place the link to the animalForm on the root/home (‘/‘) page for your site.
  // /views/index.ejs: Added a cookieConverter utility function, and displayed links to either delete the cookie or go to the form 
  
  If the animal isn’t set, have it link to the form to create the animal. 
  
  If it is set, have a button next to it that deletes the cookie.
  // routes/animals.js: Added a route to delete the cookie and redirect to the home page

  After:
    Added authentication for the routes
    Fixed login bug with password
