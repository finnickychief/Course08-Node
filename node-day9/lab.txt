	Create a form to input your favorite animal and save it to cookies. Add this animal both to the database for Animals, and store it as a session cookie for the user that was logged in at the time. Place the link to the animal on the root/home (‘/‘) page for your site. If the animal isn’t set, have it link to the form to create the animal. If it is set, have a button next to it that deletes the cookie.
