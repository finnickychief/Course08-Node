Ecommerce Project - 
  Prepare questions as if you were walking into a first meeting with a client that wants an Ecommerce website - and that is all that you know about them.

  5 - What is the nature of my business
    - I sell home-made craft products


  12 - What is an example of a competing website + what features do you like/dislike about it.
    - Etsy - I do not like it because they take too much off the sales but I love their brand image

  Edit: Who are your competitors and what do you believe are your advantages over them? 

  Added: Why are you deciding to create a website? 
  Followup: What are your goals and how will you measure the success of this website?

  7 - Do I have a budget and/or timeframe for this website
    - We have 3 days, but a good questions

  8 - Who is my target audience?
    - Right now it's mostly millenials and stay at home moms
  Added: What sort of perception do you want to project to your users and visitors of the site?


  15 - Do you have a current website? - Followup: With who? What are the costs? What are you willing to go up to?
    - No current website, I run everything through email and facebook currently.
  Added: Do you have any branding materials or a style guide yet?

  13 - What other services other than strictly web development do you require? SEO, art/design work that needs to be made such as logos, any brand images, photography for products
    - I have a logo and provide my own photography, but do not know how to optimize for SEO. I also have a process for handling my own shipping, but need to have a way to automatically create labels
  Be aware of the amount of work you'll to do, and also when you should outsource it. 
  Examples: Any content writing that needs to be done. Design beyond simple layouts. 



  3 - What kind of payment platform do I want to use? - and what am I using right now
    - Right now I'm using paypal and freshbooks, but wants to be able to use a more friendly credit card platform such as stripe


  9 - How do I plan to market my site?
    - I have no plans currently other than continuing updating my facebook page.



  14 - What are your immediate needs and what do you think would be good to add in the future?
     - Immediate: storefront, a way to add and update products, a way for users to check out. In the future, email lists, discount codes.
    Note: Make sure they know what they need right away and what can wait.


  18 - How much do you want to be able to control the website through interface options built into the website vs me handling those changes?
    -  The only things that need to be built in are adding, updating, removing products. The static pages do not need to be modifiable outside of a code editor


  17 - How will the customers interact with the website?
    - I want all the browsing, ordering and payment to be automated and I'd be available to handle any other disputes through email or phone.
  Added: Browser compatibility - Do they know how a user is most likely to come to their website and interact with the interface

  10 - What information do I want associated with a product?
    - Price, description, 3-4 photos max, wait time/number available
  11 - Do you want a shopping cart or do you only handle single orders?
    - Yes, a shopping cart would be useful since I have a variety of items
  16 - After the site is made, what are your plans for maintenance and updates?
    - I was hoping you could host it and I would cover the costs, and we could discuss updates as necessary.

    - I enjoy Amazon, and mizzen&main
  20 - How much search functionality do you want?
    - Basic matching

  23 - Hosting/Launch - How will you handle deploying the website and keeping it running? Do they have aurl, and need to redirect it? Do they want you to host it and pay you to maintain it or do they want full control over it and you out of the picture.
